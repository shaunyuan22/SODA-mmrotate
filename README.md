## Update
The evaluation codes are updated, which now support multi-processing and multi-GPU parallelism and significantly boosts the evaluation efficiency ðŸš€
For intuitive comparison, we show the overall time cost before and after applying the updated evaluation script as follows.
| Steps | Before | After |
|:--------------------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Merge | ~20m | 25s |
| IoU Calculation | ~1h30m | ~105s  |
| Per Image Evaluation | ~2h20m  | ~135s |
| Accumulation | ~17s | ~17s |
| Overall| ~4h40m | ~280s  |
The results are tested on four RTX2080Ti GPUs with Rotated FCOS.

## Introduction

This project is based on the open source object detection toolbox [MMRotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate), please refer to [Installation](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for installation instructions first.

The benchmark experiments work with **Python 3.8**, **PyTorch 1.10** and **mmrotate 0.3.0**, and corresponding configs can be found at `sodaa-benchmarks`. 

## Data preparation
Please refer to [tools/data/sodaa](https://github.com/shaunyuan22/SODA-mmrotate/tree/main/tools/data/sodaa) for more details.
