## Introduction

This project is based on the open source object detection toolbox [MMRotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate), please refer to [Installation](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for installation instructions first.

The benchmark experiments work with **Python 3.8**, **PyTorch 1.10** and **mmrotate 0.3.0**, and corresponding configs can be found at `sodad-benchmarks`

## Data preparation
Please refer to `tools/data/sodaa` for more details.
